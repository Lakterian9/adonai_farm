# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Adonai Farm website enhancement focuses on completing the missing pieces in your existing React/Express farm management system. You already have solid Docker setup, authentication, basic CRUD for animals, and a foundation for gallery/reports. This enhancement will fill the gaps to make it production-ready.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a farm manager, I want the missing Login route and proper authentication flow, so that I can securely access the farm management system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user visits the root URL without authentication THEN the system SHALL redirect to /login
2. WHEN the user submits valid credentials THEN the system SHALL store the JWT token and redirect to dashboard
3. WHEN the user submits invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages
4. WHEN the user's token expires THEN the system SHALL redirect to login page

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a farm manager, I want to upload and manage photos in the gallery, so that I can document my farm activities and animals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the gallery THEN the system SHALL display uploaded photos from the backend API
2. WHEN the user uploads a photo THEN the system SHALL use the existing /api/gallery/upload endpoint
3. WHEN the user uploads a photo THEN the system SHALL show upload progress and success feedback
4. WHEN photos fail to load THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without breaking the layout

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a farm manager, I want enhanced animal management with edit and delete capabilities, so that I can maintain accurate livestock records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views the animals list THEN the system SHALL display edit and delete buttons for each animal
2. WHEN the user clicks edit THEN the system SHALL show a form pre-populated with current animal data
3. WHEN the user clicks delete THEN the system SHALL require confirmation before deletion
4. WHEN the user updates an animal THEN the system SHALL use PUT/DELETE endpoints on the backend

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a farm manager, I want a proper Reports page with visual data, so that I can analyze farm performance and generate useful reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses reports THEN the system SHALL display charts showing animal statistics over time
2. WHEN the user generates reports THEN the system SHALL provide export options using existing CSV endpoint
3. WHEN the user views reports THEN the system SHALL show summary statistics and trends
4. WHEN there's insufficient data THEN the system SHALL display helpful messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a farm manager, I want improved styling and mobile responsiveness, so that the application looks professional and works on all devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses any page THEN the system SHALL display consistent, professional styling
2. WHEN the user views on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL show mobile-optimized layouts
3. WHEN the user interacts with forms THEN the system SHALL provide proper validation and feedback
4. WHEN the user navigates THEN the system SHALL highlight the current page in navigation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the Docker configuration to work correctly, so that the application can be deployed easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed with docker-compose THEN the system SHALL start both frontend and backend services
2. WHEN the frontend makes API calls THEN the system SHALL properly proxy requests to the backend
3. WHEN the backend starts THEN the system SHALL initialize the database and seed admin user
4. WHEN services restart THEN the system SHALL maintain data persistence through Docker volumes
